= FemtoHTTP =

FemtoHTTP is a lightweight subsystem for handling HTTP network traffic that compiles as a framework for OS X and a static library for the iPhone/iPod Touch. It doesn't support much now, but is designed to work better than the sack of suck that is CFNetwork.

Status: *in progress*
  * Source: [http://code.google.com/p/micro-frameworks/source/browse/#svn/FemtoHTTP/trunk/FemtoHTTP FemtoHTTP/]
  * Documentation: TODO
  * Binaries: TODO

== Features ==
  * Fully compatible with the iPhone SDK
  * Pure Objective C
  * No external dependencies
  * Trivial to consume
  * Full HTTP/1.1 support (keep-alive, chunked encoding, etc)
  * Connection pooling

== Limitations ==
The goal of the framework is to remain small, easy to use, and general, and as such it does not contain a lot of fluff features. Below are some of the things that I left out, but may add in the future.
  * No HTTPS - could add SSL as an optional dependency
  * No HTTP authentication - don't care

== TODO ==
  * Unit tests (also test for memory leaks)
   * Different servers
   * Pooling
   * String encodings
   * IPv6
   * Proxies/authenticated proxies
   * POST/HEAD
   * Socket stuff
  * Better memory behavior (less autorelease so less pool clutter)
  * Feature list, in decreasing order of importance:
   # 'Keep-Alive: timeout=N, max=M' support
   # Automatic redirect following/better handling of redirects
   # Cookie set/get
   # Content-Encoding: gzip / Accept-Encoding: gzip
   # 100 Continue support for request bodies
   # Documentation
   # Partial content (Content-Range/Range/206)
   # Proxy authentication
   # Pipelining mode (batch requests/responses)
