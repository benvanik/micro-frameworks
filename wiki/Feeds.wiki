= Feeds =

Feeds is a lightweight RSS/Atom feed reading library that compiles as a framework for OS X and a static library for the iPhone/iPod Touch. It currently supports some common subset of information between RSS and Atom, and is designed to be read-only.

  * Source: [http://code.google.com/p/micro-frameworks/source/browse/#svn/Feeds/trunk/Feeds Feeds/]
  * Documentation: TODO
  * Binaries: TODO

== Features ==
  * Fully compatible with the iPhone SDK
  * Pure Objective C
  * No external dependencies
  * Trivial to consume
  * Serialization/deserialization of feeds to/from plist
  * Simple merge management (allowing for caching/incremental updates)
  * Simple update engine and local storage

== Limitations ==
The goal of the framework is to remain small, easy to use, and general, and as such it does not contain a lot of fluff features. Below are some of the things that I left out, but may add in the future.
  * No write support - don't care about publishing (yet)
  * Partial support for feed entities - I only need some of them, and wanted to be consistent
  * No hierarchical data structure (nested categories, etc) - that's for the UI to do

== TODO ==
  * Unit tests (also test for memory leaks)
  * Sorting of categories/entries
  * Better memory behavior (less autorelease so less pool clutter)
